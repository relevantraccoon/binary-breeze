# Binary Breeze: Quick Decimals

Binary Breeze: Quick Decimals is a simple web application built with React and TypeScript that converts binary numbers to decimal numbers. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering binary numbers and instantly displays the corresponding decimal value.

Based on the specification by [Florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md), the app follows the following constraints:

- Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user.
- The decimal equivalent of each binary digit must be calculated using a single mathematical function, such as the natural logarithm. You have the freedom to choose the appropriate function for the conversion.

## User Stories

- As a user, I can enter up to 8 binary digits in a single input field.
- The application validates the input and notifies the user if anything other than a 0 or 1 is entered.
- The decimal equivalent of the binary number is displayed in a single output field.

## Bonus Features

- Users have the flexibility to enter a variable number of binary digits, expanding the functionality beyond the initial limit of 8 digits.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- Material-UI (MUI): React UI framework for styling and components.
- Create React App: Tool for setting up React projects quickly.
